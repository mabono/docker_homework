This is an instruction on how to run this task properly

1. Directory task2 should be the working directory for this project, please navigate to it

2. In the Dockerfile, there are two variables that define the process of building:
    - RUN_TESTS(default=true) - determines whether the test should be executed during image building or not. It takes arguments: true/false
    - TEST_CASE(default=test_add_pass.py) - determines which test should be executed: designed to pass or fail. It was created to improve the verification whether the build will stop, as desired, during the process. It takes arguments: test_add_pass.py/test_add_fail.py

4. BUILD - simply run the following command:
    - ' docker build -t <image_name> . --build-arg RUN_TESTS=<true/false> --build-arg TEST_CASE=<test_add_pass.py/test_add_fail.py> '
    By default, if we ommit changing the arguments, it will run a properly designed test, meant to pass, and the build will be successfull.
