This is an instruction on how to run this task properly

1. Directory task1 should be the working directory for this project
2. Download config directoryu with config.yaml file from the repository and save it's local path

3. BUILD IMAGE - to build an image, navigate to the local directory task1 (conatains hom1.py, docker files and empty config dir).
    In terminal, run command: ' docker build -t <image-name> . ' to build and image

4. Create container with config passed in volume - to do that, find the local path to the config folder and use it appropriately in the following command:
    ' docker run --name <conatiner-name> -v <local-path-to-config-dir>:/app/config <image-name> '

5. As a result u should get a working container and see the output of script hom1.py, which would be a statement whether the weather is good or bad, depending on the config file
